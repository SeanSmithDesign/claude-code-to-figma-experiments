# Twitter Thread: Code to Canvas

Drafted collaboratively with Claude Code. Typos in quoted prompts are intentional — they're real, unedited prompts from the session.

I've been building a lot more in Claude Code lately. So when Figma launched Code to Canvas this week I had to try it.

"ok, lets try to generate_figma_design, doens't matter what i"m looking proof of connection."

From there it was pure experimentation:

"Awesome, can you make them sized for an iphone and put a phone frame around each screen?"
"Also not sure I like the dark mode. lets switch it up to light mode"
"I think that may be worse..."

Describe, generate, screenshot, refine. 4 screens, 3 completely different aesthetics. Never opened Figma.

Custom Claude Code skills made the iteration loop repeatable:

/design-brief to set style constraints before coding
/design-review to score the output after
/workflows:compound to document learnings

Now I'm packaging these into a compound engineering plugin to make the whole flow shareable.

Nothing here is pixel perfect. There's plenty to improve. But these are real milestones. And Figma isn't the only one pushing this direction. The code to design space is moving fast.

Looking forward to what's next.
